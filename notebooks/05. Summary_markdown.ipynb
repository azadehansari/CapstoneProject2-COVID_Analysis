    "# COVID-19 Patient Survival Prediction Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. One crucial aspect of managing the pandemic is predicting patient outcomes based on their symptoms and medical history. This project aims to predict whether COVID-19 patients will survive using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SGD Classifier, and XGBoost. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project consists of COVID-19 patients' medical history and symptoms. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, comorbidities, and various symptoms experienced by the patients.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SGD Classifier, and XGBoost to predict the survival of COVID-19 patients based on their medical history and symptoms. The evaluation metrics indicated that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest** and **Logisitc Regression** performed well in terms of both accuracy and AUC scores for both ROC and precision-recall curves.\n",
    "- **XGBoost** also showed high performance and was competitive with Random Forest but not as good.\n",
    "- **SVM** took so long and did not finish the execution so **SGD Classifier** was replaced which performed significantly poor. \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and resource allocation. Future work can involve exploring other advanced machine learning algorithms, incorporating additional data sources, and fine-tuning the models for improved performance.\n",
